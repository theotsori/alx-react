# React Redux Reducers and Selectors

This guide explains the basic concepts of Redux reducers and selectors, which are essential for managing state in your React applications. These concepts help you handle data efficiently and keep your app's performance in check.

## Redux Reducers

Reducers are functions in Redux that manage how your application's state changes. They take the current state and an action as inputs, and they return a new state.

### Creating Reducers

To create a reducer, define a function that takes two parameters: the current state and an action. The action describes what happened, and the reducer decides how to update the state based on that action.

Example of a simple counter reducer:

```javascript
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

## Redux Selectors

Selectors are functions that extract specific pieces of data from the Redux store. They help prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance by fetching only the needed data.

### Creating Selectors

To create a selector, define a function that takes the entire Redux state as input and returns the desired data. Libraries like Reselect can enhance selectors by caching results for faster access.

Example of a simple selector to get the counter value:

```javascript
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

const selectCounter = state => state.counter;

const makeSelectCounter = createSelector(
  selectCounter,
  counter => counter
);

export { makeSelectCounter };
```

## Conclusion

Redux reducers manage how your state changes, while selectors help you efficiently retrieve data from the state. By using these concepts, you can maintain a well-structured and performant React application.
